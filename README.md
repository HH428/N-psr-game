# psr-game
An paper-scissor-rock game simulator in Matlab

This a simple paper-scissor-rock game simulator in Matlab. I built it in 10 min while my wife disussing the winning strategy in psr game.


The simulation results show in Matlab command windows as follow. 

```
** Round# 10 **

--------
2-paper VS 2-paper
--------
 Alice wins 5 times, rate is 62.50 percentage 

 Bob wins 3 times, rate is 37.50 percentage 
** This Round Ends ** 
```

You may change player's strategy in the code by yourself.
